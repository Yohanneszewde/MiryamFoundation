# MiryamFoundation
The unimaginable harsh and difficult situation my wife and I had at the birth of our daughter Miryam was the core reason for us to establish the Miryam Habtom foundation. When I reflect on the 29th day of October 2015, it was one of the most unimaginable, harsh and difficult moments we ever faced. Our daughter had physical complications after her birth in Bern, Switzerland but we are so grateful we had access to such an incredible medical team of doctors and nurses with state-of-the-art equipment at the Inselspital in Bern. If it wasn’t for their professional care, we don’t know what would have happened to our daughter. It was difficult for family, friends and us, but as time has gone by, things have been better by the grace of God. Though born with visual, hearing and breathing problems, Miryam is now living a normal life; she’s active and even goes to school, though she needs extra medical care. We are so grateful to be in this privileged country, because if she were born in an environment with poor medical facilities, or untrained staff, chances of her survival would really have been limited.
